                Farewell to the ordinary 2019, all teachers and students in our G7C1 class welcomed a brand new 2020,
                All students welcomed the arrival of the new year with full enthusiasm.
                The past 2019 gave us a lot of memories and tears and distress when everyone was fighting
                together, but more are the laughter and harvest, and the experience of everyone working together to
                make progress and grow together. "We can all be heroes of the times, and we can dominate our own lives." For each of us,
                The new year is a new beginning. We forget the honors and failures of the past and straighten our waists again.
                Striding forward. The sun on the first day of the new year brings new hope, we are full of
                ideals,
                Towards a new goal. Dreams belong to every brave, struggler, dream chaser,
                Belonging to the whole class we have New Year's wishes and pursuits, we can only act
                Only by taking solid steps can we achieve the other side of success and realize our own wishes for the New Year.
